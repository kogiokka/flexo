= Flexo

Flexo is a voxel-based model editor based on Self-Organizing Map.

Flexo is still in early development stage, and not yet ready for production.

== Building

The program requires C++17 and uses CMake as its build system.

=== Dependencies

 * wxWidgets 3.2.2.1
 * glm 0.9.9.8
 * glad (bundled)
 * librvl (bundled)

There are FetchContent scripts to download and build the dependencies
automatically, so you should be able to compile the project without any
prerequisite.
